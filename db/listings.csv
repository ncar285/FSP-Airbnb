About Us: Welcome to Bridgeport Reservoir Marina and Campground. Join us for the classic camping and fishing experience with unique views of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. Within the Toiyabe National Forest, Bridgeport Reservoir Marina and Campground is conveniently located near two distinct hot spring areas. A true angler's paradise, the Reservoir has excellent trout fishing from spring through fall and is close by to multiple rivers for incredible fly fishing. A short 30-minute drive to Tioga pass will bring you straight into the heart of Yosemite National Park. Off-road enthusiasts will have a heyday will the plethora of 4x4 trails in the area as well as the famous trail that brings you right to the Bodie Ghost Town.

Climate & Ecosystem: At 6,400 feet (1,950 meters), this high desert climate has little to moderate tree coverage and gets hot during the days and cool at night. The conditions are much like Joshua Tree National Park or Alabama Hills camping area. During your visit, you will notice many flying insects that resemble mosquitos. These Chironomidae are harmless and do not bite. On the contrary, the mosquito presence is very minimal.

Lake Levels: Due to this devastating drought across California and the Western United States, reservoir levels are low. As of August 1st, 2022, Bridgeport Reservoir is approximately 10 feet below normal. Swimming is not advisable at this time, but fishing and boating activities are still up and running.

5,Mini-Mod #3 at The Sea Ranch.,11,"Despite accolades from esteemed international design and travel publications (which it has from Monocle, Dwell, Travel + Leisure and many more), this perfectly designed and laid out home isn’t about pomp; it’s about simplicity and reliance upon the natural environment that surrounds it. That was the point when it, and a handful of others, were built in the mid 1960’s to showcase Northern California’s famed Sea Ranch project —and the way humans might one day find a better way to live with nature.
The space
The house, dubbed MiniMod #3, was designed by acclaimed mid-century architect Joseph Esherick. It’s set privately in coastal forestlands beneath towering redwoods, with no adjacent neighbors in sight. Inside, 684 square feet are divided among three open floors, with original architectural features and mid-century furnishings orchestrated by award-winning preservation architects, Framestudio. The two bedrooms (one of which with a door for privacy), efficient yet well-appointed kitchen (with dishwasher), full bathroom (with a full tub and shower), and 110 mbps internet ensure the space can flex to accommodate a number of needs from work to relaxation. From every point in the structure, forest-filtered light seeps through picture windows, gently reminding you of the natural wonders outside — or the private hot tub, set under a canopy of redwoods.

The space, perfect for a couple or two and small families of up to four, can’t answer for the chaos elsewhere in the world, but it can answer for your comfort and daily routine while you’re within its walls or exploring the towering redwoods or the craggy Pacific coast beyond.

Come experience the MiniMod #3 and discover life as it should be: beautifully simplified.
Other things to note
A few things to note:
• The Mini-Mod is an architecturally significant tiny house, built in 1968 as one of the original demonstration (model) homes by the developer of the Sea Ranch. It is best suited for those who appreciate it's history and respect it's age and fragility.
• Well-behaved children are welcome, however the original staircase is hazardous to small children.
• Children who misbehave may be abducted by the local Sasquatch. The same has occasionally applied to adults.
• There is a strict one dog limit.
• Along with the romantic open fireplace, come the smells of woodsmoke. If you are sensitive to scents, please be advised. Firewood and starters are provided.
• The redwood forest is home to all manner of creepy crawlies. Occasionally, they do get inside the cabin.
• Because of the remoteness of the Sea Ranch, power outages can occur during all seasons.
• We offer a 120V outlet for car charging.

Live your wine country dream walking the south vineyard rows or swimming in the infinity pool above the north vineyard. Only eight minutes from Sonoma Square this newly built, multi-building modern estate is situated in one of Sonoma's most exclusive areas and popular bike riding loops.
The space
The spaces can accommodate eight adult guests plus children. With four bedrooms (including the pool house) and four bathrooms there is plenty of comfort for a good size group. All bedrooms have ensuite baths except the kids room which shares the hall bath.

You’ll enjoy absolute privacy at a completely remodeled home with exacting and thoughtful touches and views of the hills bordering Napa. It's an easy drive or bike ride to the center of town where you’ll find some of the best restaurants and shopping in the county.

The grand, seventeen foot sliding bay door in the living room opens the house up to stunning indoor/outdoor living with a wrap around porch. A dining table on the deck, with radiant heaters and string lights, seats 12 directly above the north vineyard for joyous breakfasts and breathtaking sunset dinners.

Single level living means you can see almost the entire property from the kitchen and living room to keep an eye on pool use and comings and goings. Great for elderly guests as there are fewer than five steps to access anywhere on the main living level of the property.

The pool and hot tub have a couple really cool features including a ""Baha deck,"" lol which is a six inch deep portion where infants can crawl around and enjoy the water (with adult supervision of course) or you can place one of the lounge chairs there to cool off on hot days. There is also a sitting shelf that runs the entire length of the pool so you can sit in the pool and enjoy a glass of wine while staring out over the infinity edge and Napa hills. The pool cover has a motorized open and close to ensure safety if kids and toddlers are around. You can heat the hot tub to your hearts content for free. The pool is solar heated and can be made even warmer, especially in the winter, with gas heat for an additional charge.

The kitchen is built for cooks with a four burner plus indoor grill Thermador range with a 20,000 BTU high burner and extra low simmer function. And don't forget TWO dishwashers for easy cleanup. On the kitchen deck there is a four burner, 72,000 BTU grill with a ceramic side sear burner. There is also a temperature set Pit Boss wood pellet grill for smoked grilling or low and slow hot smokes. Kitchen also has a high-end blender, sous vide immersion cooker, mixer, food processor, etc. Several Michelin star cooks have prepared meals in this kitchen.

The 2,000 sq ft lawn is lush and fun. Large enough for a soccer game or big dog run. Poolside couches and chairs have six inch cushions and umbrellas for shade. There are five mesh lounge chairs for sunning and napping.

You'll find little nooks of fun throughout the property whether it's huddling around the firepit by the pool house, playing a game of bocce above the north vineyard, reclining in one of the adirondack chairs on the wrap around porch or enjoying one of two outdoor showers.

The property is solar powered with Tesla battery and generator backups so is minimally impacted by PG&E blackouts. We have two 50 AMP EV chargers on the property for both Tesla fast charging and NEMA 14-50 charging.

The Starlink internet is blazing fast for the country at 150-200 mbps down and 15-20 mbps up. Very low latency for solid zoom calls. Cell service is spotty, but wifi calling works great and there is a landline telephone for backup .

15,The Kellogg Doolittle House,3,"This is the famous Kellogg Doolittle estate in Joshua Tree California. It is one of the most exclusive homes in the world, and available for the first time as an Airbnb Luxe exclusive.

Created over 25 meticulous years, Kellogg Doolittle in Joshua Tree National Park is a marvel of the organic architecture movement. A residence that is so “one-of-a-kind,” nearly every element, inside and out, is handcrafted by architect Ken Kellogg and Master Craftsman John Vugrin. The masterpiece of organic architecture sits along the breathtaking landscape of Joshua Tree National Park, the location that lent itself as the ambitious vision and inspiration behind the design. 

Kellogg, a former protege of Frank Lloyd Wright, has taken organic architecture to new levels with this outstanding house. The Kellogg-Doolittle House contains no straight lines or rectangular spaces. Instead, the house forms around 26-winged piers composed of organic material built quietly into the natural landscape: the kitchen and living room stretch softly around an unmoved, million-year-old rock formation, while the glass panels peek into a sprawl of sunrise and sunset views. 

Located on a quiet edge of Joshua Tree National Park, you have your private path into an un-trafficked section of the park, just steps from the front door. Take an easy drive to the main park entrance, start your exploration with a stroll through the Cholla Cactus Gardens, snap a few photos at Skull Rock, and hike the Hidden Valley Nature Trail; or stay at home, shut the world out, sit around the fire pit and wait for a chance to see the Milky Way in your exclusive dark sky view. If you're in the mood for city life, Palm Springs is an easy hour’s drive. 

The Kellogg Doolittle home offers unparalleled privacy, quiet, park access, and remote property bouldering. Step away from the rest of the world in this one-of-a-kind home.

19,"Whiskey Hollow, A Cozy Cabin in the Redwoods",9,"Romantic retreat! Wake up to bird song through the skylights, lounge on the deck under the redwoods with a cup of coffee, luxuriate in the oversized bathtub with candles, and cozy up in front of the wood fireplace. Whiskey Hollow is a true get-away! Nestled in the woods, you would never guess that you're only 2 miles from downtown Felton, 1.5 miles from Henry Cowell State Park, 15 minutes from downtown Santa Cruz, and 20 minutes to the beach. Super cozy and--did we mention? Romantic!!!
The space
Charming, cozy, peaceful, this A-Frame cabin in the woods is the perfect place for a romantic get-away. Snuggle up in the comfy queen bed in the loft, and morning will greet you with a stunning view of the redwoods without even having to leave the bed. (Did we mention it's romantic??)

When you do muster the energy to start your day, a fully equipped kitchen awaits and provides the opportunity to cook a big breakfast, lunch or dinner. Felton offers two nearby markets: Wild Roots and Safeway. If you decide you'd like to barbecue, there is a charcoal grill on the lower deck for your use. Take a seat in one of the Adirondack chairs or at the picnic table while you wait for dinner to finish and enjoy the view--you will see lots of birds and squirrels, and may see deer or our local flock of wild turkeys!

The main level of the home consists of a sweet bedroom (full bed), a dining/work area, a living room with a sofa, a loveseat and a large ottoman, a wood-burning stove, television and an entire wall of windows that look out onto sun-dappled forest. Additionally, you'll find the fully-equipped kitchen and the bathroom with a generous two-person tub you may never want to leave.

The upstairs loft has a mini office (with a lovely view!) at the top of the stairs. At the far end of the loft is the cozy queen bed, two luggage racks and an area to hang clothes.

In case you need an iron and ironing board, you will find them on the lowest level.

Consider Whiskey Hollow your home away from home. During your visit, please feel free to enjoy the television, board games, books, popcorn, coffee and tea. And remember: the kitchen is fully equipped, so if you'd rather whip something up than get takeout, you're all set.

During the summer, we have a window air conditioning unit. Combined with the ceiling fans and the fan setting on the thermostat, this keeps the cabin nice and cool.

Note to families: Both sets of stairs are fairly steep, and there is a stairway off the deck. There is no baby/toddler/child-proofing in the house, so please proceed with caution if you elect to bring the little ones. If you are bringing the little ones, let us know--we will set out the bins of Legos and trains!

Felton is in a forested area, and fire is a very real hazard in the dry months.
Please leave coals and ash in the fireplace or the barbecue so that we may dispose of them safely. Also: Absolutely no smoking or vaping inside or outside the home. Thank you for protecting our home and our neighborhood.

We do live here part-time, so while the cabin will be clean and uncluttered, you will see some personal items (i.e. clothes, shoes, books) tucked away.

We have a sweet dog too and, though the house will be clean for your arrival, if you are allergic to dogs, this may not be a good fit for you.

*Important Note: Our community - Felton - was one of those threatened by the CZU Lightening Complex wildfire, which included forced evacuation on 8/20/20. On 8/29/20 we were cleared to re-enter our home which experienced NO damage (blessings counted...whew!!!!). While Felton was completely untouched by the fires, several communities and state parks to the north experienced damage. Santa Cruz (including beaches) and the portion of Henry Cowell State Park within Felton proper were not damaged. If you choose to stay at Whiskey Hollow, it's possible that you may not even be aware that it was in the path of the wildfires, particularly if your activities take you to the coast or south. That said, if you would like more information before you book, please don't hesitate to message us. We look forward to hosting you!

We would just like to say: we LOVE hosting! We are not on-site, but we do love creating a space that surprises and delights! Whiskey Hollow has been on Airbnb for over 3 1/2 years, and while we were initially nervous about sharing our home with folks we had never met, the experience has been surprisingly rewarding. We have hosted guests on their honeymoons, babymoons, anniversaries, birthdays, girls' weekends, and more. And our favorite thing? Hosting repeat guests. We find Whiskey Hollow to be a really special place, and when guests decide to return, we believe it is because this little cabin in the woods is special to them, too.

Okay. On to the details.

Please be sure to read through the House Manual upon check-in. It will help you make the most of your stay, as well as remind you of a few requests we make to keep you and our home in good shape. Also, if you have any suggestions for how we can make this amazing place even better, we'd love to hear from you. Please leave us a note at the house or private message us. And of course, if you run into any issues during the course of your stay, do not hesitate to contact us.

Finally, if you have your heart set on escaping to Whiskey Hollow, we recommend booking sooner rather than later. We tend to fill up, especially around holidays and other events.",349,171 Par Drive,93101,CA,4,2,2,1,FALSE

A: Unfortunately no, PML only allows homeowners to launch their boats on the lake. All other smaller water crafts must be registered and permitted with the marina before entering the lake. We provide kayaks and paddle boards that are already permitted, so feel free to use these during your stay!

Q: Why are prices different depending on which days I select?
A: We use automated pricing software that sets nightly prices based on demand and comparable properties. Rates change based on a variety of factors and we typically just let the software do its thing.

Q: Can I have an early check-in or late check-out?
A: We do our best to accommodate these requests whenever possible! We usually cannot commit to an answer until approximately a week in advance of your reservation, so send us your request as your reservation approaches and we'll see what we can do for you.

Q: Do we have to do chores at check-out?
A: Upon check-out, we ask that guests do their dishes and take out the trash so there isn't anything that attracts unwanted critters between your departure and our cleaning crew's arrival. Thank you for your understanding and support!
