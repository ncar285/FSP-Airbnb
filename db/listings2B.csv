19,"Whiskey Hollow, A Cozy Cabin in the Redwoods",9,"Romantic retreat! Wake up to bird song through the skylights, lounge on the deck under the redwoods with a cup of coffee, luxuriate in the oversized bathtub with candles, and cozy up in front of the wood fireplace. Whiskey Hollow is a true get-away! Nestled in the woods, you would never guess that you're only 2 miles from downtown Felton, 1.5 miles from Henry Cowell State Park, 15 minutes from downtown Santa Cruz, and 20 minutes to the beach. Super cozy and--did we mention? Romantic!!!
The space
Charming, cozy, peaceful, this A-Frame cabin in the woods is the perfect place for a romantic get-away. Snuggle up in the comfy queen bed in the loft, and morning will greet you with a stunning view of the redwoods without even having to leave the bed. (Did we mention it's romantic??)

When you do muster the energy to start your day, a fully equipped kitchen awaits and provides the opportunity to cook a big breakfast, lunch or dinner. Felton offers two nearby markets: Wild Roots and Safeway. If you decide you'd like to barbecue, there is a charcoal grill on the lower deck for your use. Take a seat in one of the Adirondack chairs or at the picnic table while you wait for dinner to finish and enjoy the view--you will see lots of birds and squirrels, and may see deer or our local flock of wild turkeys!

The main level of the home consists of a sweet bedroom (full bed), a dining/work area, a living room with a sofa, a loveseat and a large ottoman, a wood-burning stove, television and an entire wall of windows that look out onto sun-dappled forest. Additionally, you'll find the fully-equipped kitchen and the bathroom with a generous two-person tub you may never want to leave.

The upstairs loft has a mini office (with a lovely view!) at the top of the stairs. At the far end of the loft is the cozy queen bed, two luggage racks and an area to hang clothes.

In case you need an iron and ironing board, you will find them on the lowest level.

Consider Whiskey Hollow your home away from home. During your visit, please feel free to enjoy the television, board games, books, popcorn, coffee and tea. And remember: the kitchen is fully equipped, so if you'd rather whip something up than get takeout, you're all set.

During the summer, we have a window air conditioning unit. Combined with the ceiling fans and the fan setting on the thermostat, this keeps the cabin nice and cool.

Note to families: Both sets of stairs are fairly steep, and there is a stairway off the deck. There is no baby/toddler/child-proofing in the house, so please proceed with caution if you elect to bring the little ones. If you are bringing the little ones, let us know--we will set out the bins of Legos and trains!

Felton is in a forested area, and fire is a very real hazard in the dry months.
Please leave coals and ash in the fireplace or the barbecue so that we may dispose of them safely. Also: Absolutely no smoking or vaping inside or outside the home. Thank you for protecting our home and our neighborhood.

We do live here part-time, so while the cabin will be clean and uncluttered, you will see some personal items (i.e. clothes, shoes, books) tucked away.

We have a sweet dog too and, though the house will be clean for your arrival, if you are allergic to dogs, this may not be a good fit for you.

*Important Note: Our community - Felton - was one of those threatened by the CZU Lightening Complex wildfire, which included forced evacuation on 8/20/20. On 8/29/20 we were cleared to re-enter our home which experienced NO damage (blessings counted...whew!!!!). While Felton was completely untouched by the fires, several communities and state parks to the north experienced damage. Santa Cruz (including beaches) and the portion of Henry Cowell State Park within Felton proper were not damaged. If you choose to stay at Whiskey Hollow, it's possible that you may not even be aware that it was in the path of the wildfires, particularly if your activities take you to the coast or south. That said, if you would like more information before you book, please don't hesitate to message us. We look forward to hosting you!
Guest access
Guests will have access to the entire house minus one bedroom on the first floor, a storage room in the basement and a detached shed, all locked and unoccupied.
Other things to note
We would just like to say: we LOVE hosting! We are not on-site, but we do love creating a space that surprises and delights! Whiskey Hollow has been on Airbnb for over 3 1/2 years, and while we were initially nervous about sharing our home with folks we had never met, the experience has been surprisingly rewarding. We have hosted guests on their honeymoons, babymoons, anniversaries, birthdays, girls' weekends, and more. And our favorite thing? Hosting repeat guests. We find Whiskey Hollow to be a really special place, and when guests decide to return, we believe it is because this little cabin in the woods is special to them, too.

Okay. On to the details.

Please be sure to read through the House Manual upon check-in. It will help you make the most of your stay, as well as remind you of a few requests we make to keep you and our home in good shape. Also, if you have any suggestions for how we can make this amazing place even better, we'd love to hear from you. Please leave us a note at the house or private message us. And of course, if you run into any issues during the course of your stay, do not hesitate to contact us.

Finally, if you have your heart set on escaping to Whiskey Hollow, we recommend booking sooner rather than later.

FAQs

Q: Do you offer discounts?
A: Yes! We offer weekly and monthly discounts for longer stays.

Q: Can I bring my own boat/kayak/paddleboard/water craft?
A: Unfortunately no, PML only allows homeowners to launch their boats on the lake. All other smaller water crafts must be registered and permitted with the marina before entering the lake. We provide kayaks and paddle boards that are already permitted, so feel free to use these during your stay!

Q: Why are prices different depending on which days I select?
A: We use automated pricing software that sets nightly prices based on demand and comparable properties. Rates change based on a variety of factors and we typically just let the software do its thing.

Q: Can I have an early check-in or late check-out?
A: We do our best to accommodate these requests whenever possible! We usually cannot commit to an answer until approximately a week in advance of your reservation, so send us your request as your reservation approaches and we'll see what we can do for you.

Q: Do we have to do chores at check-out?
A: Upon check-out, we ask that guests do their dishes and take out the trash so there isn't anything that attracts unwanted critters between your departure and our cleaning crew's arrival. Thank you for your understanding and support!
