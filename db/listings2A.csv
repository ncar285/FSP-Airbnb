About Us: Welcome to Bridgeport Reservoir Marina and Campground. Join us for the classic camping and fishing experience with unique views of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. Within the Toiyabe National Forest, Bridgeport Reservoir Marina and Campground is conveniently located near two distinct hot spring areas. A true angler's paradise, the Reservoir has excellent trout fishing from spring through fall and is close by to multiple rivers for incredible fly fishing.

Off-road enthusiasts will have a heyday will the plethora of 4x4 trails in the area as well as the famous trail that brings you right to the Bodie Ghost Town.

Climate & Ecosystem: At 6,400 feet (1,950 meters), this high desert climate has little to moderate tree coverage and gets hot during the days and cool at night. The conditions are much like Joshua Tree National Park or Alabama Hills camping area. During your visit, you will notice many flying insects that resemble mosquitos. These Chironomidae are harmless and do not bite. On the contrary, the mosquito presence is very minimal.

Lake Levels: Due to this devastating drought across California and the Western United States, reservoir levels are low. As of August 1st, 2022, Bridgeport Reservoir is approximately 10 feet below normal. Swimming is not advisable at this time, but fishing and boating activities are still up and running.

5,Mini-Mod #3 at The Sea Ranch.,11,"Despite accolades from esteemed international design and travel publications (which it has from Monocle, Dwell, Travel + Leisure and many more), this perfectly designed and laid out home isn’t about pomp; it’s about simplicity and reliance upon the natural environment that surrounds it. That was the point when it, and a handful of others, were built in the mid 1960’s to showcase Northern California’s famed Sea Ranch project —and the way humans might one day find a better way to live with nature.
The space
The house, dubbed MiniMod #3, was designed by acclaimed mid-century architect Joseph Esherick. It’s set privately in coastal forestlands beneath towering redwoods, with no adjacent neighbors in sight. Inside, 684 square feet are divided among three open floors, with original architectural features and mid-century furnishings orchestrated by award-winning preservation architects, Framestudio. The two bedrooms (one of which with a door for privacy), efficient yet well-appointed kitchen (with dishwasher), full bathroom (with a full tub and shower), and 110 mbps internet ensure the space can flex to accommodate a number of needs from work to relaxation. From every point in the structure, forest-filtered light seeps through picture windows, gently reminding you of the natural wonders outside — or the private hot tub, set under a canopy of redwoods.

The space, perfect for a couple or two and small families of up to four, can’t answer for the chaos elsewhere in the world, but it can answer for your comfort and daily routine while you’re within its walls or exploring the towering redwoods or the craggy Pacific coast beyond.

Come experience the MiniMod #3 and discover life as it should be: beautifully simplified.

• Well-behaved children are welcome, however the original staircase is hazardous to small children.
• Children who misbehave may be abducted by the local Sasquatch. The same has occasionally applied to adults.
• There is a strict one dog limit.

11,Luxe Forest Cabin 15 Mins From UC Berkeley,3,"Relax and unwind at this luxurious “cabin in the woods”. This unique property is situated in a wonderfully relaxing setting, yet you are a mere 6 miles to the world-famous UC Berkeley (“Cal”). Nature abounds here and you’ll feel a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of the Bay Area - even though you're only 15 minutes to Berkeley, 30 minutes to downtown SF, and less than an hour from Napa. An ideal place to decompress and recharge away from it all while also close to conveniences.
The space
New for 2023: 2 brand new off-road trail E-bikes! See Extras section below for details.

Nestled under a towering redwood called The Sentinel and amongst 100-year-old oak trees you'll feel like you're living in your own private tree house. This architecturally designed mid century modern property features a greenbelt of woods and a seasonal burbling brook runs around the property.

Being near the charming woodland creatures really allows one to unplug from modern stress: We have a family of raccoons, beautiful deer - bucks with large antlers and mothers with their babies come this way, little foxes were born and raised nearby. You will likely hear the occasional neigh of horses stabled up the knoll and the howl of coyotes and the hooting of owls at night. And let’s not forget the dragonflies, hummingbirds wild turkeys and their other winged friends.

Note: The cabin is detached and private but it is one of three structures that makes up the compound. It sits directly above the main house and the guest cottage both of which can be seen from the cabin. Please see the photos to gain a better understanding of the layout of the property and the space.
Guest access
The cabin has exclusive access to the patios located on the levels above the main house. Enjoy a meal at the outdoor dining table with an integrated fire pit. Or just enjoy the ambiance and warmth at the coffee table fire pit, all available for your exclusive use (please note propane tanks are available for purchase. see below under “Extras”).

Relax with an indoor or outdoor spa-quality massage; male and female therapists are available same-day (additional prices apply). After a hike on the local trails with amazing views of the Bay, soothe your muscles in the private sauna with optional meditative music.

If doing work or streaming a video beckons, no problem! You’ll have highspeed wireless access to the 1Gb fiber line from anywhere on the property including the terraces and decks. If you’re concerned about cell phone coverage, enabling wifi calling on your phone ensures that you don’t miss a call (iphone: settings-->phone-->wificalling on).

If you would like to do a little work we have a work station which we can bring and setup in your cabin. For guests staying three of more nights a private office separate from the cabin is available. Just let us know.
Other things to note
A refrigerator and microwave are available in your room. We also can provide an old fashioned picnic basket complete with plates, cutlery and wine glasses for you to use on a hike or picnic in Tilden park.

The suite is both air conditioned and heated with heated bathroom floors.

A dedicated, private, non-shared office detached and perched above your cabin is an ideal space to decompress or get some work done without distraction. The office has its own private entrance and looks out to the hills beyond. The space is generally used as a private massage studio but for guests staying 3 or more nights the space can be converted to a private office upon request. See host for further details.

If you have any other specific wishes or questions, feel free to ask. I will do my best to accommodate any requests so that your stay is sublime!

Promotions:

Spa Promotion: Book 7 or more nights and receive a 20% discount on personalized, onsite massage therapy appointments.

Mobility Advisory:

The property is nestled into the side of a steep hill and the guest cabin is located at the top of the property. It is recommended that guests park on the street below the property. The driveway is long and steep. If you need help carrying luggage up please text or call me as I'm happy to help when available.

The property is not suitable for small children or people with mobility issues as there are many steps, a seasonal creek and steep drop-offs around the grounds. There are no handrails for the steps.

14,"Sonoma Vineyard Estate, Pool, Spa, Bikes",10,"Stay on a working vineyard in the heart of Sonoma with a breathtaking infinity pool and five acres of privacy. Featured in San Francisco's ""7x7"" Magazine, Barboshi Farms produces award winning Primitivo wine. Live your wine country dream walking the south vineyard rows or swimming in the infinity pool above the north vineyard. Only eight minutes from Sonoma Square this newly built, multi-building modern estate is situated in one of Sonoma's most exclusive areas and popular bike riding loops.
The space
The spaces can accommodate eight adult guests plus children. With four bedrooms (including the pool house) and four bathrooms there is plenty of comfort for a good size group. All bedrooms have ensuite baths except the kids room which shares the hall bath.

You’ll enjoy absolute privacy at a completely remodeled home with exacting and thoughtful touches and views of the hills bordering Napa. It's an easy drive or bike ride to the center of town where you’ll find some of the best restaurants and shopping in the county.

The grand, seventeen foot sliding bay door in the living room opens the house up to stunning indoor/outdoor living with a wrap around porch. A dining table on the deck, with radiant heaters and string lights, seats 12 directly above the north vineyard for joyous breakfasts and breathtaking sunset dinners.

Single level living means you can see almost the entire property from the kitchen and living room to keep an eye on pool use and comings and goings. Great for elderly guests as there are fewer than five steps to access anywhere on the main living level of the property.

The pool and hot tub have a couple really cool features including a ""Baha deck,"" lol which is a six inch deep portion where infants can crawl around and enjoy the water (with adult supervision of course) or you can place one of the lounge chairs there to cool off on hot days. There is also a sitting shelf that runs the entire length of the pool so you can sit in the pool and enjoy a glass of wine while staring out over the infinity edge and Napa hills. The pool cover has a motorized open and close to ensure safety if kids and toddlers are around. You can heat the hot tub to your hearts content for free. The pool is solar heated and can be made even warmer, especially in the winter, with gas heat for an additional charge.

The kitchen is built for cooks with a four burner plus indoor grill Thermador range with a 20,000 BTU high burner and extra low simmer function. And don't forget TWO dishwashers for easy cleanup. On the kitchen deck there is a four burner, 72,000 BTU grill with a ceramic side sear burner. There is also a temperature set Pit Boss wood pellet grill for smoked grilling or low and slow hot smokes. Kitchen also has a high-end blender, sous vide immersion cooker, mixer, food processor, etc. Several Michelin star cooks have prepared meals in this kitchen.

The 2,000 sq ft lawn is lush and fun. Large enough for a soccer game or big dog run. Poolside couches and chairs have six inch cushions and umbrellas for shade. There are five mesh lounge chairs for sunning and napping.

You'll find little nooks of fun throughout the property whether it's huddling around the firepit by the pool house, playing a game of bocce above the north vineyard, reclining in one of the adirondack chairs on the wrap around porch or enjoying one of two outdoor showers.

The property is solar powered with Tesla battery and generator backups so is minimally impacted by PG&E blackouts. We have two 50 AMP EV chargers on the property for both Tesla fast charging and NEMA 14-50 charging.

The Starlink internet is blazing fast for the country at 150-200 mbps down and 15-20 mbps up. Very low latency for solid zoom calls. Cell service is spotty, but wifi calling works great and there is a landline telephone for backup .
Guest access
Gated driveway and combo operated locks make this your personal private retreat. Depending on when you come you can also participate in the vineyard care and winemaking process. Most of the property has double fencing to keep critters out and kids and dogs in.
Other things to note
Please note: This is a WORKING VINEYARD and five acre property that needs constant care and upkeep. There will most likely be workers in the fields and on the outside of the property during your stay. No one will work inside during your stay. If you are not comfortable with field and yard workers outside during your stay, this is not the right property for you. If you have a problem with the lawn being mowed for 20 minutes during your stay, this is not the property for you. The estate needs to be maintained and we do not reschedule care services.

15,The Kellogg Doolittle House,3,"This is the famous Kellogg Doolittle estate in Joshua Tree California. It is one of the most exclusive homes in the world, and available for the first time as an Airbnb Luxe exclusive.

Created over 25 meticulous years, Kellogg Doolittle in Joshua Tree National Park is a marvel of the organic architecture movement. A residence that is so “one-of-a-kind,” nearly every element, inside and out, is handcrafted by architect Ken Kellogg and Master Craftsman John Vugrin. The masterpiece of organic architecture sits along the breathtaking landscape of Joshua Tree National Park, the location that lent itself as the ambitious vision and inspiration behind the design. 

Kellogg, a former protege of Frank Lloyd Wright, has taken organic architecture to new levels with this outstanding house. The Kellogg-Doolittle House contains no straight lines or rectangular spaces. Instead, the house forms around 26-winged piers composed of organic material built quietly into the natural landscape: the kitchen and living room stretch softly around an unmoved, million-year-old rock formation, while the glass panels peek into a sprawl of sunrise and sunset views. 

Located on a quiet edge of Joshua Tree National Park, you have your private path into an un-trafficked section of the park, just steps from the front door. Take an easy drive to the main park entrance, start your exploration with a stroll through the Cholla Cactus Gardens, snap a few photos at Skull Rock, and hike the Hidden Valley Nature Trail; or stay at home, shut the world out, sit around the fire pit and wait for a chance to see the Milky Way in your exclusive dark sky view. If you're in the mood for city life, Palm Springs is an easy hour’s drive. 

The Kellogg Doolittle home offers unparalleled privacy, quiet, park access, and remote property bouldering. Step away from the rest of the world in this one-of-a-kind home.
